    <h1>HOW IT WORKS</h1>
        
    <p>After completing all modules, an instructor will evaluate your projects and give you honest feedback as well as a final grade. Should you pass all the criterias successfully, you will be given a certificate equivalent to a level 3 degree that you can add to your portfolio.

Each course should have an average of 3 projects to complete, quite similar to what you would find in real life work environment, making them perfect to give you real experience.</p>
