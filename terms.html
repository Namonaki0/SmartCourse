    <h1>TERMS & AGREEMENT</h1>
    <h2>Last updated [August 25th, 2020]</h2>

    <p>
      These Terms and Conditions constitute a legally binding agreement made
      between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“you”) and
      smartCourse (“we,” “us” or “our”), concerning your access to and use of
      the smartcourse.com website as well as any other media form, media
      channel, mobile website or mobile application related, linked, or
      otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the “Site”).
    </p>

    <p>
      You agree that by accessing the Site, you have read, understood, and agree
      to be bound by all of these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree with
      all of these Terms and Conditions, then you are expressly prohibited from
      using the site and you must discontinue use immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the
      site from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by
      reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes
      or modifications to these Terms and Conditions at any time and for any
      reason.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of
      these Terms and Conditions, and you waive any right to receive specific
      notice of each such change.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is your responsibility to periodically review these Terms and
      Conditions to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will
      be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in
      any revised Terms and Conditions by your continued use of the site after
      the date such revised Terms and Conditions are posted.
